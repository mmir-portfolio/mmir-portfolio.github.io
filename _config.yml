title: Mammad Mirza
description: "Hi, I’m Mammad, a passionate scientist with a PhD in Engineering and expertise in subsurface resource engineering, applied machine learning, and scientific data analysis. My research spans reservoir simulation, CO₂ storage evaluation, geothermal energy, and hydrogen storage, where I combine physics-based modeling with advanced data-driven approaches to optimize safety, efficiency, and sustainability. I have also developed image processing workflows and statistical models to analyze complex subsurface datasets, applying techniques such as regression, clustering, and Bayesian inference for characterization and monitoring. Proficient in Python, I build and optimize algorithms for data processing, uncertainty quantification, and hybrid ML–reservoir modeling using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face. I am particularly passionate about integrating ethical, transparent AI into subsurface resource engineering, ensuring that innovations in CCUS, clean energy, and reservoir management contribute responsibly to the global energy transition."
