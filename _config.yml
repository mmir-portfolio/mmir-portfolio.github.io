title: Mammad Mirza
description: "Hello, Iâ€™m Mammad, an inquisitive scientist with PhD in Engineering and with expertise in subsurface resource engineering, reservoir simulation, applied machine learning and geothermal energy, and CO2 capture and sequestration. I wander mostly judiciously into topics related to Reservoir Connectivity, Production Optimization, Geothermal Energy, CO2 Capture and Sequestration, Reservoir simulation, and the application of artificial intelligence for clean energy production. I have developed image processing workflows as well as statistical models for analyzing complex subsurface datasets; the latter particularly was done for the purpose of monitoring. I used regression and clustering, as well as Bayesian inference for characterization. Further to this endeavor, I use Python and its associated frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face to design and fine-tune algorithms on data processing workflow, uncertainty quantification as well as hybrid ML-reservoir modeling."
