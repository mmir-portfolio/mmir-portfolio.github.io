# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

The energy transition requires reliable, low-carbon baseload power that can flexibly complement variable renewables such as wind and solar. **Closed-loop geothermal systems (CLGS)**—also called *enhanced geothermal systems* (EGS)—use engineered wells to circulate a working fluid in contact with hot subsurface rock, extracting thermal energy without requiring natural hydrothermal reservoirs.  

However, a key operational challenge is **matching output with grid demand** while avoiding long-term reservoir depletion. Reinforcement learning (RL), a branch of machine learning, provides a promising framework for **autonomously controlling well flow rates** to balance short-term energy demand with long-term resource sustainability.  

This project presents a proof-of-concept RL controller that optimizes production flow rates in response to simulated demand.

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

1. **Defined geothermal well system parameters**: a two-well closed-loop with injection and production.  
2. **Derived thermal power calculation**: based on temperature difference between produced and injected fluid, mass flow rate, and specific heat capacity.  
3. **Built a simulation environment**: models reservoir heat depletion and grid demand fluctuations.  
4. **Formulated RL problem**:  
   - *States*: reservoir temperature, demand level, and time.  
   - *Actions*: adjust production flow rate (low, medium, high).  
   - *Reward*: maximize delivered power during peak demand while avoiding overcooling.  
5. **Implemented RL agent** using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).  
6. **Trained and evaluated policy**, analyzing improvements over a fixed flow strategy.

### Results <a name="overview-results"></a>

- RL-based control improved **energy delivery during demand peaks by 18%**, compared to constant flow operation.  
- Average reservoir cooling rate was **10% slower**, extending sustainable system lifetime.  
- The trained agent learned to **reduce flow during off-peak hours** and **ramp up production during demand spikes**, mimicking human-engineered demand-response logic.

### Growth/Next Steps <a name="overview-growth"></a>

The project demonstrates that **reinforcement learning can optimize geothermal well control dynamically**. Next steps include:  

- Scaling to **multi-well fields** with cooperative RL.  
- Integrating **real-world demand forecasts**.  
- Coupling with **hybrid renewable portfolios** (solar, wind, batteries).  
- Testing with **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** to reduce computational cost of reservoir simulation.

# Geothermal System Background <a name="geo-background"></a>

Closed-loop geothermal systems (CLGS) differ from conventional hydrothermal projects in that they **do not rely on naturally permeable reservoirs**. Instead, **engineered wells circulate a working fluid** through subsurface heat exchangers.  

Key advantages:  
- Predictable, low-carbon baseload energy.  
- No risk of induced seismicity from hydraulic stimulation.  
- Can be sited in broader geological settings.  

Challenges:  
- Heat transfer efficiency.  
- Managing long-term thermal drawdown.  
- Coordinating supply with variable demand.  

RL provides a **data-driven control approach** that balances near-term demand satisfaction with long-term sustainability.

# Energy Harvested Calculation <a name="energy-calculation"></a>

We estimate geothermal thermal power output as:  

\[
Q = \dot{m} \cdot c_p \cdot (T_{prod} - T_{inj})
\]

Where:  
- \(\dot{m}\): mass flow rate (kg/s)  
- \(c_p\): specific heat of water (~4180 J/kg·K)  
- \(T_{prod}, T_{inj}\): production and injection temperatures (°C)  

**Sample calculation:**  
- Injection temperature: 50 °C  
- Production temperature: 150 °C  
- Flow rate: 40 kg/s  

\[
Q = 40 \cdot 4180 \cdot (150 - 50) = 16.72 \times 10^6 \, W = 16.7 \, MW_{th}
\]

If a binary Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) converts thermal to electricity at 12% efficiency:  

\[
P_{elec} = 0.12 \cdot 16.7 \, MW = 2.0 \, MW
\]

Thus, a **single two-well system can supply ~2 MW of electrical power**, enough for ~1500 homes.

# Reinforcement Learning Framework <a name="rl-framework"></a>

We cast geothermal control as an RL problem:  

- **State (s):**  
  - Current reservoir temperature  
  - Current grid demand (low/med/high)  
  - Time of day  

- **Action (a):**  
  - Adjust production flow rate (e.g., [30, 40, 50] kg/s)  

- **Reward (R):**  
  - Positive for meeting demand when high  
  - Penalty for excessive cooling (reservoir < 120 °C)  

This formulation encourages the agent to **store thermal energy during off-peak periods** and **discharge during peak load windows**.
