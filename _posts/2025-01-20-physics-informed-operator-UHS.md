In this project, we developed a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model to predict hydrogen breakthrough time in underground porous reservoirs. By generating synthetic permeability datasets and incorporating two-phase flow physics with capillary pressure effects, the model learns the complex mapping from heterogeneous permeability fields to breakthrough time. This approach enables rapid, reliable predictions without running computationally expensive reservoir simulations, supporting faster site screening, operational planning, and performance evaluation for underground hydrogen storage systems.

# 00. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is emerging as a critical technology for seasonal energy storage and grid balancing in clean energy systems. Hydrogen can be injected into saline aquifers or depleted reservoirs and later produced when energy demand increases. However, predicting **hydrogen breakthrough time**—the moment when hydrogen arrives at the production well—is a major challenge due to the complexity of multiphase flow, capillary pressure, and heterogeneous permeability fields.

This project introduces a **Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)** to learn a mapping:

**Permeability Field → Breakthrough Time**

By the end of this document, you will:
- Understand the physics of two-phase H₂/brine flow in porous media.
- See how to generate simplified synthetic datasets.
- Learn how to build and train an FNO model.
- Explore how physics constraints can improve generalization.

# 01. Background: Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) <a name="background"></a>

UHS involves injecting hydrogen into subsurface formations. Key processes:
1. Multiphase flow of hydrogen and brine
2. Density and viscosity contrast
3. Capillary trapping
4. Diffusion and dispersion
5. Reservoir heterogeneity

# 02. Governing Physics: Two-Phase Flow with Capillary Pressure <a name="governing-physics"></a>

∂S/∂t + ∂f(S,k)/∂x = ∂/∂x (D(S) ∂S/∂x)

Capillary pressure:
Pc(S) = P0 * S^{-1/λ}

Fractional flow:
f = (λ_H₂) / (λ_H₂ + λ_brine)

Breakthrough occurs when S(x=L) exceeds a threshold.

# 03. What Is Breakthrough Time? <a name="breakthrough-time"></a>

Breakthrough time (t_b) is when hydrogen first reaches the production well. Depends on:
- Permeability structure
- Injection rate
- Mobility ratio
- Capillary forces

# 04. Why Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)? <a name="fno"></a>

FNO learns mappings between function spaces:
- Input: permeability field k(x)
- Output: breakthrough time t_b
- Learns spatial patterns using spectral convolution
- Efficient and mesh-independent

# 05. Dataset Generation (Simplified) <a name="dataset"></a>

- Generate random 1D permeability fields.
- Compute breakthrough time using surrogate formula t_b ≈ L / v.
- Add capillary correction term.
- Normalize and store input/output.

# 06. FNO Architecture Overview <a name="architecture"></a>

- Lifting layer (linear)
- 4 SpectralConv1D layers
- Nonlinear activation
- Projection to output

# 07. Training Strategy <a name="training"></a>

- Loss: MSE
- Optimizer: Adam
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau

# 08. Physics-Informed Regularization (Optional) <a name="physics-informed"></a>

Penalty term for monotonicity:
L_total = L_data + λ * L_physics

# 09. Evaluation Metrics <a name="evaluation"></a>

- MAE
- R² score
- Generalization
- Physical consistency

# 10. Real-World Applications <a name="applications"></a>

- Storage site screening
- Injection scheduling
- Uncertainty quantification
- Real-time decision support

# 11. Future Directions <a name="future"></a>

- Extend to 2D/3D
- Full multiphase simulators
- DeepONets or PINNs
- Operational optimization

# 12. Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Physics-informed FNO models accelerate UHS analysis, predicting breakthrough time directly from permeability fields with speed, generalization, and interpretability.
