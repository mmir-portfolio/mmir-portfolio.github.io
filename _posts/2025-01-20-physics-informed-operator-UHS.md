In this project, we developed a physics-informed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) model to predict hydrogen breakthrough time in underground porous reservoirs. By generating synthetic permeability datasets and incorporating two-phase flow physics with capillary pressure effects, the model learns the complex mapping from heterogeneous permeability fields to breakthrough time. This approach enables rapid, reliable predictions without running computationally expensive reservoir simulations, supporting faster site screening, operational planning, and performance evaluation for underground hydrogen storage systems.

# 00. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is emerging as a crucial solution for storing renewable energy. Hydrogen can be injected into porous geological formations for seasonal storage. Predicting **hydrogen breakthrough time** is essential to ensure operational efficiency, safety, and maximum storage utilization.  

This project demonstrates how **Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)** can predict breakthrough time based on **permeability field heterogeneity**, while respecting multiphase flow physics and capillary pressure effects.

# 01. Background: Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) <a name="background"></a>
UHS involves storing hydrogen in subsurface formations like **depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers**. Operational challenges include:

- Heterogeneous permeability fields affecting flow patterns  
- Two-phase hydrogen/brine flow dynamics with capillary trapping  
- Diffusion and dispersion of hydrogen  
- Constraints on injection pressure and total storage volume  

Machine learning approaches like **FNOs** help accelerate breakthrough time predictions compared to full multiphase simulations.

# 02. Governing Physics: Two-Phase Flow with Capillary Pressure <a name="governing-physics"></a>
Hydrogen saturation \(S_{H2}\) in porous media is governed by:

<div style="text-align:center;">
φ ∂S<sub>H2</sub>/∂t + ∇·(f(S<sub>H2</sub>) v) = ∇·(D(S<sub>H2</sub>) ∇S<sub>H2</sub>)
</div>

Capillary pressure affects flow as:

<div style="text-align:center;">
P<sub>c</sub>(S<sub>H2</sub>) = P<sub>0</sub> · S<sub>H2</sub><sup>-1/λ</sup>
</div>

Where:  

- φ = porosity  
- f(S<sub>H2</sub>) = fractional flow  
- D(S<sub>H2</sub>) = diffusion coefficient  
- v = Darcy velocity  
- P<sub>0</sub>, λ = capillary pressure parameters  

# 03. What Is Breakthrough Time? <a name="breakthrough-time"></a>
Breakthrough time \(t_b\) is defined as the moment hydrogen saturation at the production well exceeds a small threshold (e.g., 0.01).  

It depends on:  

- Permeability distribution  
- Injection rate  
- Fluid properties (viscosity, density)  
- Capillary pressure  

Accurate prediction allows operators to plan **injection schedules** and **avoid early breakthrough**.

# 04. Why Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)? <a name="fno"></a>
FNOs learn **mappings between function spaces**, making them ideal for heterogeneous permeability fields:

- **Mesh-independent**: works across different grid resolutions  
- **Global correlations**: captures long-range interactions in permeability  
- **Physics-informed**: PDE constraints can be added as part of the loss  

FNOs generalize better than CNNs for unseen permeability realizations.

# 05. Dataset Generation & Simulation Workflow <a name="dataset"></a>
Dataset generation involves:

- **Permeability fields**: log-normal distribution, scaled 0.1–1 Darcy, Nx=128 grid  
- **Two-phase flow simulation**: simple solver including capillary pressure  
- **Physical parameters**:  
  - φ = 0.25  
  - μ<sub>H2</sub> = 0.09 mPa·s  
  - μ<sub>brine</sub> = 1 mPa·s  
  - P<sub>0</sub> = 2000 Pa, λ = 2  
  - Grid points = 128, time step Δt = 1 day  
- **Breakthrough time**: S<sub>H2</sub> ≥ 0.01 at production well  
- **Train/test split**: 80/20  

This balances **physical realism** and computational efficiency.

# 06. FNO Architecture Overview <a name="architecture"></a>
- **Input lifting**: 1 → 32 width  
- **Four spectral conv layers**: 16 Fourier modes  
- **Residual pointwise conv layers**  
- **Activation**: ReLU  
- **Output projection**: width → scalar (t<sub>b</sub>)  
- Optional physics-informed loss: PDE residuals

# 07. Training Strategy <a name="training"></a>
- Loss = MSE_data + λ·PDE_residual  
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-3)  
- ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=10)  
- Batch = 32, Epochs = 50–100  
- Track metrics: MSE, MAE, physical consistency

# 08. Prediction & Inference Pipeline <a name="prediction"></a>
- Normalize permeability fields  
- Forward through FNO  
- Denormalize t<sub>b</sub>  
- Compare with simulated results  
- Sensitivity analysis for input parameters

# 09. Visualization & Interpretation <a name="visualization"></a>
- **Predicted vs true t<sub>b</sub>** plots  
- **Saturation profiles** for samples  
- **Residual maps** for spatial error  
- Ensure **physical consistency**: lower permeability → higher t<sub>b</sub>

# 10. Evaluation Metrics <a name="evaluation"></a>
- MAE, R²  
- Physical consistency checks  
- Sensitivity to φ, P<sub>c</sub>, injection rate

# 11. Industry Relevance & Deployment <a name="applications"></a>
- Rapid site screening for UHS feasibility  
- Planning injection/production schedules  
- Reducing need for expensive simulations  
- Early detection of breakthrough events

# 12. Future Work & Extensions <a name="future"></a>
- Extend to 3D reservoirs  
- Integrate real-world P/T measurements  
- Bayesian FNO for uncertainty  
- Hybrid DeepONet + FNO  
- Real-time predictive monitoring for operational safety

# 13. Python Implementation <a name="python"></a>
Below is a complete Python implementation that demonstrates the development of a Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict hydrogen breakthrough time from heterogeneous permeability fields. The workflow is built entirely in PyTorch, leveraging FFT-based spectral convolutions for efficient operator learning. The code includes dataset generation, model definition, training, and evaluation steps, all designed to emulate the underlying two-phase flow dynamics with capillary effects in porous media. This implementation serves as both a research prototype and a foundation for scaling to larger 2D or 3D reservoir models.
